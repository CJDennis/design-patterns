# design-patterns
PHP implementations of the design patterns described in
Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Orientd Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

These classes are for demonstration puroposes only. Although the code is fully working and tested,
it is not general purpose code, so is not fit for every project that has a need for these patterns.
Read the book for the caveats of each pattern, when they're appliable, and what customisations
might be necessary.

You can study these classes to see one way of implementing them in PHP, hopefully in a clean way.
